Multirotor Rig

This code is destined for a physical simulator system that uses an electronic speed controller (ESC) to drive two brushless inrunners.

You might find this as a good example of how to use proportional-derivative control and how to use a electronic speed controller. I found that there wasn't many easy to follow examples for the latter - although this might not be the easiest to follow either, I have made a decent attempt to comment the code.
